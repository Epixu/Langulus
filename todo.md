## In progress:
- ALL CONCEPTS NEED TESTS, because I just fixed a plethora of logical mistakes in them. can't stress this enough.
- ~~`Block::Emplace` doesn't return a handle if sparse!~~ Same applies for mutable iterators!!! ~~same applies for `operator[]`!!!~~
- Implement external reflections, by allowing all CT concepts be defined by an external template specialization
- Persistent performance testing and benchmarking integrated with test utilty to keep track of performance regresses

## TODO:
- Latest `BlockMap::Rehash` and widening while insertin needs to be carried over to `BlockSet`
- Saturation can be done either via op, or through conversion. Add saturation to VXXX::Pack routines, because currently fallbacks saturate at different places.
- `BlockMap` speed optimizations: dynamic `AllowedMisses` based on table size; Anticipate oversaturation while swapping
- How come sparse map tests don't involve sparse keys??
- Type erased map insertion is not defined
- `mInfo` in maps moves around to first map entry, so that iterations always beging with the first pair
- Implement ordered maps and sets using an ordering array of indices after the `mInfo` array - that way we can directly transfer maps between ordered/unordered variations without any trouble
- Use redundant map data (`mValues.mCount` and `mValues.mReserved`) for keeping track of ordering array
- Add multiplication operators to meta types to multiply by their size
- In future standards, make sure we exclude reflected bases that don't qualify as 'direct'; route imposed bases through a semantic instead (but why??)
- Test a block that contains multiple different interleaved groups of coalesced elements for a pretty nasty bad block destruction corner case
- Partially successful block transfers that get interrupted by an exception should unallocate the items that were successfully initialized
- Test if vector/point/normal/sampler/etc. constructors make sense and play well with semantics, when inside containers
- It would be _really_ cool if `Langulus::Logger` supports markdown, through `_md` literal for example? Will save on a lot of `Logger::Command` pushes
- Move ASCII image support directly to `ModAssetsImages`
- Is it possible to use generator function to iterate blocks based on concepts?? like: `ForEach([](const CT::Block auto& block) {...})` ????? that would be bloody awesome. Should be possible only for non-type-erased ones?
- Test all containers with `void*/const void*`
- Test all containers with double pointers, including for `void**/const void* const*`
- Test containers with function pointers, make them executable
- Events wouldn't be serializable or deterministic with this kinds of timestamp. Use the relative time context for it?
- Unnecessary Block code includes double the compilation time - minimize those. Maybe separate include files with separate intents?
- ### Separate `CT` into a separate concept library, carry all canonical types like `A::Block` and `A::Verb` with it?
- Extensive `Block::SmartPush` tests are needed - preserving states, like staticness, must be ensured.
- `Derive`/`Integrate` verb
- ### Separate containers into reusable components
- Make `Any` specialized for one element only (`std::any` analogy)?
- `TestTemporal.cpp` moved to `Entity` library - make it work, and it is going to be a big deal!
- Open/Closed range support in `Code` parser
- Handle escapes in Code's string/char parser - symbols like `∞` screw with attached operators, because op can't be isolated around them
- `;` operator for parsing order-independent lists (`Neat`)
- `->` mapping operator for assembling pairs? also could be useful for `if` statements
- `|` operator for assembling sets?
- Add font size to `Logger` using ASCII art
- Drop `CT::Complete` in various `CT::Destroyable` and other similar checks to avoid silencing incomplete types
- Generate coverage on clang CI https://releases.llvm.org/19.1.0/tools/clang/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html
- `Block::Compare` comparisons of non-similar pointer types to the same virtual objects are sketchily implemented
- Anyness tests are very sensitive to states left from other tests - more strict measures were implemented in TestHashing, but it still remains to spread them to other tests
- When stringifying text containers, make sure the text literal operator isn't found in the string itself - use ` if there's a " and vice versa, use escapes if both
- When `deducing this` is implemented for `clang-cl`, use it to reduce a plethora of const/mutable function equivalents, and use `if consteval`
- ### Add `emcc` to the CI and pass tests
- Map and set iterations tend to iterate to the end of `mInfo`, despite having gone past the inserted `mCount`
- Test all containers with aggregates
- Should we somehow allow `LANGULUS_VERBS(Verbs::Multiply)` without a `void Multiply(Verb&)` member if operators are already defined?
- `Clamp` and possibly other math functions don't work with tags for some reason. Add Vector tests for these as well.
- Do SIMD functions work with `volatile` arguments?
- Can we insert `volatile` stuff into containers?
- `constexpr memcpy` and `memmove` utilizing `if consteval`? Mainly for `TVector` constructors

## Done:
- Create a common test utility library to reduce boilerplate in tests
- Improve color addition, currently overflows/underflows, needs saturation
- Improve color subtraction, currently overflows/underflows, needs saturation
- Improve color multiplication, currently overflows/underflows, needs saturation
- Rounding real numbers when serializing to `Text`
- `TColor>` - a weird defect in `NameOf`? Time to sanitize and check for reserved or invalid tokens upon reflection...
- Add all includes under a common Langulus folder, for example: Langulus/Core Langulus/Math, etc.
- Why hardcode `Traits::Parent` to be not participating in hashing? Just add the trait as missing, so that it is dynamically linked depending on the context, and exclude all linking points from hashing???
- `SIMD::Not` unary implemented
- `TSet` and `TMap` destructors destroy referenced elements! See `Converter::Input::mResources`. Fixed!
- Intents preserve `volatile` qualifiers
- Rename `Constraint` to `Bond` - an emergent unit that is often produced on collision, when some electromagnetic/chemical interaction forms a strong bond, linking bodies and forcing them to share kinetic and potential energy
- Smaller HTML tags for Logger
- Ditch `monocast` nonsense, and instead create custom wrapper types with a dispatcher? This simplifies flows A LOT.
- Check where the new `Types::ForEach` pattern can be useful to reduce code - yes, yes it can.
- Constants tested in `RTTITest`
- When tests are enabled in `Release` with `SAFE_MODE` some will fail in some framework libraries (like Fractalloc) - investigate!
- `Many::Past()` and `Many::Future()` should accept arguments as filters? ~~or even better: remove missing states, add new containers instead! use the ones in Flow~~
- Fractalloc::Reallocate should work only if 1 ref
- `Loop::Discard` can cause the container to `BranchOut` while looping - make sure any raw pointers used for iteration are synchronized after element removal
- RTTI origin type reflector doubles the compilation time - minimize those. Luckily disabling `NameOf` didn't affect anything - just the main reflection routine does. Reduced by the addition of `LANGULUS(ACT_AS)`
- `Traits::Time` conflicts undetectedly with `Langulus::Time` - fix it! - Fixed by hinting whether its trait using first letter case - traits are always lowercased
- Code should use `{}` instead of `[]` for nested code blocks
- Cleaned up the concept of `CT::POD`
- Added `NameOf` corner case tests where the typename starts or ends overlapping with the provided `helper_name`
- `Many` of the containers call two destructors instead of one, inherit directly from `Block/BlockMap/BlockSet` to avoid it
- Rename `Crop/CropInner` to `Select`
- Fix vector swizzling with itself, once and for all
- Fix tags assigning different tags
- Fix scaling/translation sneaking in normal transformation in ASCII rasterizer
- Renamed `Any` to `Many`
- Removed `CT::Inner` duplicated concepts, use `Decay` when needed to use the non-inner version.
- Instead of appending a `Logger::Tabs{}`, just make a variant of `Logger::<Type>Tab`!
- Rename `Semantic` to `Intent`, and `NotSemantic` to `NoIntent`
- Standalone constants reflection
- Remove `CustomNameOf` wrappers when constexpr variables can be moved outside scopes in newer standards. Fixed by just allowing LANGULUS(NAME) to be std::array

## Abandoned:
- Experiment with using `RTTI::SomeTrait;` and detecting those upon reflection instead of using macros; traits can have more advanced options on how a base can propagate to derived classes, etc.
- Since `Couple` is now invoked by the user's whim, `mOwners` is now invalid in unit constructors. Which means that we can safely discard non Aux versions of hierarchy seek interface - just rely always on the descriptor! No, the non-aux functions are still used on Refersh routines.
